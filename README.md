# dsa thingy

So here I'll be adding DSA-related code and also maybe like  
my reflections after solving each problem â€” 'cause I've been procrastinating this for quite some time now...

Gotta lock in!

Also, you can check out my [Twitter](https://x.com/sodakeyEatsMush) where I post cool stuff.

I'll be maintaining a log about my learnings at [my DSA Log on Notion](https://www.notion.so/DSA-Log-224f1129214e80f2b9d0c035a10dc839?source=copy_link).
